          <p class="not-centered">I’m a Web Developer working in JavaScript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Ruby on Rails. Previously, I worked in management for two years at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Being a manager built my leadership skills immensely alongside teaching me a great deal of responsibility. I also became a much stronger mentor on the work front and personal front. Currently, I’m working on building a full-stack React application similar to Netflix using Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML5, and CSS3.</p>
